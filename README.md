Simple box clearing game in 3 different variations

Click on groups of 2 or more boxes. The more matching at once, the more points you receive. 

In Timed mode cleared boxes collapse and then refill

In Vertical mode boxes come in from the bottom one row at a time. The longer you play the faster they fill.
